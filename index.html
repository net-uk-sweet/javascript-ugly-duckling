					<h3>The Ugly Duckling</h3>

					<img class="title no-border" width="626" height="772" src="assets/title.png" alt="Awwwww.">

					<aside class="notes">
						Wanted to do something with general appeal so that more just a couple of developers turned up. Also, I thought it might be less work. I'm going to talk you through the history of JavaScript and show how it's gone from quite humble beginnings, to one of the most popular, and I think, most important, programming languages in the world today. And I'll be hanging the whole thing of this rather flimsy duck metaphor.

						<h2>1995</h2>

						<ul>
							<!-- a stat here might be nice -->
							<li>World Wide Web had taken off</li>
							<li>Netscape Navigator ruled</li>
							<li>IE didn't exist</li>
							<li>First browser war looming</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							WWW had gone from a tool used primarily by university science departments, to widespread public attention and use, almost overnight. Prompted by the release of Mosaic, which was the first graphical web browser, which was released in 1993.
							By 1995 Netscape Navigator was the most popular browser with 60% share. IE didnt' even exist yet, version one was releaseed in August with Windows 95. Version 2.0 was released 3 months later. Right on the cusp of the first browser wars 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Netscape Navigator 1.0</h2>
						<img width="800" height="600" src="assets/ns1c.gif" alt="Navigator 1.0">

						<aside class="notes">
							Netscape had adopted hot new programming language Java as part of it server solution. Wanted a light-weight language which they could embed in the browser. Which would compliment Java and appeal to non-professional programmers. Was anyone developing in 1995? Basically they were talking about a few thousand web developers.

						<h2>Brendan Eich</h2>

						<div class="profile">
							<img width="350" height="350" src="assets/brendan-eich.jpg" alt="Brendan Eich">

							<ul>
								<li>CTO of Mozilla Corporation</li>
								<li>Father of JavaScript</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							So they got this guy here, Brendan Eich. And they said to him - we want you to write a language to embed in the browser, and it needs to be a bit like Java, and it needs to be dynamic and interpreted, so no compilers or anything like that. And we need it in 10 days. So he went off, probably moaned a bit, and then got down to work and wrote the language. 10 days later he presented it to his bosses, and they said yeah that looks good. Seems to work. Cool, let's go with it. And so it shipped with the next version of Navigator. As an important side note here, Microsoft reverse engineered the whole language, including all the mistakes I'm about to talk about, and called their version jScript. It shipped in IE 3.0 the following year.

						<h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>

						<img class="story-border" width="500" height="536" src="assets/ugly-duckling.jpg" alt="The Ugly Duckling">

						<!-- These bullet points are really boring. Maybe just run with the duck -->
						<!-- ul>
							<li>Borrowed bits from Self and Scheme</li>
							<li>Grafted on a C-like syntax</li>
							<li>Ripped off Java's Math and Date objects</li>
							<li>Prototypical inheritence</li>
							<li>Half-baked classical inheritance</li>
						</ul -->

						<aside class="notes">
							So as you can imagine, this thing which was knocked together in 10 days and shipped without any real testing, it was a bit of an ugly duckling. 
						</aside>

					</section>
					<!-- this could be a candidate for skipping -->
					<section>
						<h2>The really bad bits</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Global variables</li>
							<li>Overloaded + operator. 5 + "5" = "55"</li>
							<li>Automatic semi-colon insertion</li>
							<li>Broken typeof</li>
							<li>Type coercion rules</li>
							<li>false, null, undefined, NaN</li>
							<li>Broken floating point numbers. 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							And there was some really bad stuff. Some you might call idiosyncracies of the language, others are just plain bugs. This is the stuff that Brendan Eich himself says are really bad. 
							This is the most boring slide so I won't dwell on it, but if you're a developer who has worked with JavaScript at all, there's a good chance you've been stung by some of these at some stage.

						<aside class="notes">
							It was a bit of a mess, and the other languages started picking on it. You don't look like us. You're kind of a noddy language aren't you? You can't do any serious programming with you. There's no debugging tools. You're really slow. The DOM API is horrible. Generally, JavaScript, you suck.

						<aside class="notes">
							Something important did happen in that time. Netscape handed over the language to the European Computer Manufacturers Association and they wrote a specification around the language. This is a good thing. 1999 version added regular expressions, improved string handling. It's more or less what we use today.

								<li>UX Designer</li>
								<li>Described AJAX (2005)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							Brilliant name. Two characters from the history of the American West in one name. Whitepaper (Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications). Described a set of technologies which already existed which could be used together to allow developers to send and receive data from the server and update the display in the browser without having to refresh the page. Meant that we could move away from the really static webpages of the time to something much more dynamic. Really important because it meant that the web application was possible.

						</blockquote>			
						<small>wikipedia</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							All these libraries built on JavaScript started popping up. mootools, prototype and of course jQuery. Made it really easy to write this new breed of dynamic functionality in the browser. Alternative to broken DOM API, hiding the browser inconsistencies behind a single API.

							<li>Google maps</li>
							<li>Google docs</li>
						</ul -->

						<!-- image of children playing with the swan here -->

						<aside class="notes">
							And I think this is the point in the story where someone says to JavaScript, look at your reflection. You're not an ugly duckling. 
							Because google saw a real opportunity in this space, and importantly, they recognised the potential of JavaScript to help them deliver web applications. So they took a punt and built gmail and google maps. is pretty much the archetypal web application. It's the example which is most often used when people talk about them.

						<!-- Just the logo maybe here. Move the mission statement to its own page-->

						<aside class="notes">
							But in the process of building these, they became frustrated by the limitations of the current crop of browsers, which were basically the biggest barrier to success. JavaScript engines and DOM were slow, support was inconsistent. So they asked themselves well, how hard could it be to write your own browser? So they did. And google Chrome was born
						</aside>

						<h2>Chrome Mission Statement</h2>
						
						<blockquote class="wide" cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
							<p>&ldquo;We realized that the web had evolved from mainly simple text pages to rich, interactive applications and that we needed to completely rethink the browser.</p> <p>What we really needed was not just a browser, but also a modern platform for web pages and applications, and that's what we set out to build.&rdquo;</p>
						</blockquote>			
						<small>google, 2008</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							And I know this is long, but I couldn't really see where to cut it, so I'll just read it. It's a statement which google published along with the beta of Chrome for Windows in 2008. It's long, but I think it really illustrates some of the things I've just been talking about.

						<aside class="notes">
							Another round of the browser wars. Overtook IE in 2008. Now 40% to IE's 30%. Chrome and Firefox release every 6 weeks. IE is now annually. Implement new features very quickly, and fix bugs. Fewer people on out-dated browsers.

							Most popular on github. there are more open source projects hosted on github tagged JavaScript than any other language. Developers, hands up if you use stack.
